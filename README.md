Repository for our Tower Defense game project

Authors: Andrew, Justin
Project Initiated: June 2nd, 2021

Plan: The idea of the game is to develop a basic ‘tower defense’  game. The idea of the game is to allow a player to place down ‘towers’ that will target ‘entities’ that are following a set path. The objective is to prevent these entities from reaching the end of the path and the challenge of the game is trying to find out a layout that can effectively execute the objective. Resources required for the game are individual sprites for towers and enemies, a map with a clear-cut path and available space for towers, tutorial or an explanation phase in the beginning of the game, a menu that would include a play button, a options button, a tutorial button, and an exit button, a money system that would allow the user to earn money from destroying entities and they would need to use the money to deploy towers, and Music (potentially).
